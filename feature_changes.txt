# Process, notes, and changes concerning the feature: connection to S3

### the purpose of this branch is to establish a working connection to an existing AWS S3 Bucket

The current pool_apr.db is only for development and lacks automation of data processes. The S3 bucket connection will be to the same one updated daily by a AWS Lambda service to allow for up to date data visualization.


changes:

-create public url for S3 object 'pool_apr.db' via AWS web console
-define functions to check / update apps current working version of database
---checks for date creation of database vs time now in epoch time. if older than 1 day, removes current database and downloads current from s3 bucket url
-restructure index route to allow for database update functions


new imports:
-datetime
-wget
-os


KNOWN ISSUES:
-exception thrown when index.html accessed in tandum with database update. Need to restructure / multithread / return apology.html
